# ðŸ¤– About Project  

A simple automation tool to post tweets directly from WhatsApp messages. This bot integrates WhatsApp and Twitter APIs, enabling to streamline the process of sharing messages from WhatsApp to Twitter â€” even when using WhatsApp on a mobile phone!


## ðŸ’¥ Problem

Long story short, in my circle, a small study group, has a twitter account to share WFC (work from/study from cafe) that are open to the public. But there is only one person who holds this twitter account.

So, this was built. We just chat in the whatsapp group like usual, of course with a certain prefix, to post tweets on the twitter account.



## ðŸš€ Features 

- **WhatsApp Automation**: Post a tweet like sending a chat
- **Twitter Integration**: Posts messages directly to Twitter account via the Twitter API v2.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly with WhatsApp from mobile phones and desktops.
